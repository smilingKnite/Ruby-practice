# One thing we have not talked much about is the Ruby keyword self. 
# Self refers to whatever object called that method. 
# In Ruby, everything is an object so self can mean a lot of different things. 
# Let's open the Fixnum and String classes and see self working in different contexts.

class Fixnum
  def who_am_i
    puts self
  end
end
class String
  def who_am_i
    puts self
  end
end
4.who_am_i # => 4
15.who_am_i # => 15
"string".who_am_i # => "string"
"hello_world".who_am_i # => "hello_world"

# Let's create a Mammal class in a separate file and use self in our own class.
class Mammal
  def initialize
    puts "I am alive"
  end
  def breath  
    puts "Inhale and exhale"
  end
  
  def who_am_i
    # printing the current object
    puts self
  end
end
my_mammal = Mammal.new # => "I am alive"
my_mammal.who_am_i # => #<Mammal:0x007f9e86025dd8>
my_mammal.who_am_i.breath # => undefined method `breath' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)

#########################################################################################
# In the last line of our script, we tried to chain methods. 
# However, we get a NoMethodError that 'breath' is an undefined method for a nil value. 
# The reason is that since the puts method prints the value and returns nil, 
# the value that is getting returned from our instance methods is nil. 
# To be able to chain methods, our instance methods need to return an object, 
# more specifically, they need to return self.


class Mammal
  def initialize
    puts "I am alive"
    self
  end
  def breath  
    puts "Inhale and exhale"
    self
  end
  
  def who_am_i
    puts self
    self

my_mammal = Mammal.new.who_am_i.breath
